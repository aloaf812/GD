# Geometry Dash (1.700) Decompilation

Disclaimer: This is a **work-in-progress** decompilation of Geometry Dash version 1.700. It is not in a usable state and cannot be used to play Geometry Dash.

# Build Instructions

You can find the build instructions for both iOS and Android [here](https://github.com/aloaf812/GD/blob/1.7/USAGE.md).

# Why decompile 1.7?

GD 1.7 was the first and only version to use [cocos2d-x 2.2.3](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/releases/tag/cocos2d-x-2.2.3) mostly without any modifications, which removes the need to decompile the engine, making decompilation much more straightforward.
